      "Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla disclosed that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had offered former PNP chief Nicolas Torre III a position in the government’s anti-corruption unit. He said the offer was part of the administration’s effort to make use of Torre’s experience after his brief stint as police chief. The specific role was not detailed, but the move was described as consistent with the administration’s governance reforms. The announcement came amid public speculation over Torre’s next assignment following his relief.",
      "Remulla added that discussions were ongoing and that Torre’s response had not yet been finalized. Political observers noted that reassignments of former police leaders are common to ensure continuity of institutional knowledge. The development came just days after Torre’s removal and the appointment of Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. as Officer-in-Charge of the PNP. The statement placed Torre’s possible new role within the broader context of anti-corruption initiatives."

      "The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.0 percent, marking the third consecutive cut this year.

The BSP projected that inflation will remain within its 2 to 4 percent target range through 2027.",

Financial markets responded positively, interpreting the decision as a measured step. The adjustment underscored the central bank’s focus on sustaining economic recovery while guarding against inflationary pressures."

      "The Commission on Audit affirmed with finality its 2020 ruling upholding a notice of disallowance issued to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) over P95.46 million in allowances granted to employees in 2014. The decision rejected PhilHealth’s appeal to lift the disallowance, saying the state insurer was reusing arguments that had already been dismissed. The allowances in question included hazard pay, subsistence, and laundry benefits. COA stressed that while PhilHealth employees are considered public health workers, their entitlement to benefits is not automatic and must comply with the Magna Carta of Public Health Workers and its implementing rules.",
      "According to COA, hazard pay applies only to workers in hospitals and facilities dealing with contagious diseases, radiation exposure, or correctional and conflict zones where risk of harm is present. Subsistence allowance is limited to health workers who are on-call at all times in government hospitals or institutions. PhilHealth’s legal vice president Jose Mari Tolentino argued that the Supreme Court recognized PhilHealth personnel as public health workers, but COA said that classification does not override the statutory conditions. The ruling underscored the need for proper guidelines to prevent misapplication of allowances."
